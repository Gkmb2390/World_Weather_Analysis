# Purpose of Excercise

    Testing and creating weather and google maps api's.  Through the use of the random function we generated large quantities of data, specifically Latitudes and Longitudes. in order to develop multiple tuples of city coordinates.  Using those coordinates we developed weather maps using an api with openweathersource.com, then with Google maps we were able to plot the cities and show the significance of the weather events from within our Dataframes.

    Additionally we created a "vacation" planning api that worked in conjunction with Google apis to be able to identify specific cities with a max and min desired temperature, plot those cities in Google Maps, and even design direction maps and show the hotels and current weather desctiptions within each city.
